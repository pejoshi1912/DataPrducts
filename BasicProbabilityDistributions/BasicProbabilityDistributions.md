Basic Probability Distributions
========================================================

Introduction 
------------

This web app provides an easy and interactive way to experiment 
with 4 basic probability distributions

- Normal Distribution
- Poisson Distribution
- Uniform Distribution
- Binomial Distribution

User Friendly Interface
========================================================


- Easy to use 
- only side bar panel and main panel 
- Select any distributions on side bar panel
- Main panel show the selected distribution with default values
- Manipulate the parameters using sliders 
- The plot is changed according the parameters

Usefulness
========================================================



- Specially useful for biginners
- To understand basic shape of a probability distribution
- To be familier with different parameters of a distribution
- To see affect of different combinations of parameters on the shape of distribution


Future Scope
=========================================================


- Many advance probability distributions can be added 
- Will be useful for everyuser from naive to expert
